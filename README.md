# OhLaBash
This is a demo (an animation) I wrote in 100% pure bash. It should run most major gnu/linux distros without any dependencies.
It's 12kb and it even has music !

It was presented at the Shadow Party 2025 but unfortunately the audio part did not work as expected. 
It uses PulseAudio (paplay) in order to play sounds in parallel. 
PulseAudio is usually pretty standard but it tends to be replaced by PipeWire. So if you want to run it on you machine make sure PulseAudio is present ! If not you can install it with   :  
sudo apt install pulseaudio-utils
